##### Introduction
* * *
**Raavi** (in Farsi means "Story teller") is a modularized shiny web app (interactive web app with back-end in R Statistical language) for visualization of high school and university scores data. It was a great experience for me on both UI/UX and Server part to build a complicated shiny app as efficient as possible. Using many great visualization packages in R like ggplot2, plotly, shinywidgets, rhandsontable, JS packages. challenges in writing a complicated shiny app.
